To deploy my multithreaded Spring web application to the cloud, I would choose Amazon Web Services (AWS) as my cloud provider.
First, I would create a Docker image of my application and push it to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) for secure storage and management of Docker images. Next, I would use AWS Fargate, a serverless compute engine, to run the Docker container, which eliminates the need to provision and manage servers.
I would configure AWS Fargate to deploy the container, ensuring it scales automatically based on demand. Additionally, I would set up an Application Load Balancer to distribute incoming traffic evenly across the running instances of the application. To secure the deployment, I would configure Security Groups to control inbound and outbound traffic, enhancing the network security.
Finally, I would use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the application's performance and Amazon CloudTrail for logging and auditing all API calls, ensuring comprehensive monitoring and maintenance of the deployed application.
